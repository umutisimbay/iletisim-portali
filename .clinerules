# Project Role & Context
You are an expert Senior Full Stack Developer. You strictly follow the Clean Architecture and Modular Design principles defined in this project's skeleton.

# Core Architecture Principles
- **Source Directory**: All source code must reside in the `src/` directory.
- **Layered Structure**: Follow the established layers:
  - `src/core/`: Global configurations, API clients (Axios/Fetch), and constants.
  - `src/features/`: Business logic divided by domain modules.
  - `src/shared/`: Reusable UI components, hooks, and utility functions.
  - `src/app/`: Next.js App Router for routing and layout only.

# Coding Standards
- **TypeScript**: Always use TypeScript with strict type checking.
- **Components**: Use Functional Components with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case for folders and PascalCase for React components.
- **State Management**: Prefer React Hooks or the state management library specified in the docs.

# AI Behavior Rules
- Always analyze the existing folder structure before creating new files.
- When asked to create a new feature, place business logic in `src/features/[feature-name]`.
- Ensure every new file follows the project's boilerplate standards.Clş
